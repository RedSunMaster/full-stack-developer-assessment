# Schooldocs Todo App Frontend

This is the frontend for the Schooldocs Todo application, designed as part of the full-stack developer assessment. The application is built using React and a UI framework of your choice to showcase your design skills.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure you have clone the repository** on your machine.

2. **Navigate to the codebase**:

   ```bash
   cd frontEnd
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install the required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   Use the following command to start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Open the application**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

## Design Considerations

- You are welcome to write your own styles or use any UI framework of your choice to enhance the design.
- Feel free to use TypeScript to demonstrate your proficiency in type safety and code maintainability.
- Reused code

## Connecting to the Backend
This frontend is configured to proxy requests to the backend server running on [http://localhost:7777](http://localhost:7777) or any custom port used in the backend. Ensure that the backend server is running before starting the frontend application.

Good luck with your assessment, and we look forward to reviewing your work!
